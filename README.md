# Personal Blog

Initially a mini-project to cover over a weekend.

Creating a personal blog site utilising Eleventy, Nunjucks in conjunction with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The aim of the blog is to highlight current events in my life whether it is technology based or a more personal interest.

This site is not currently hosted, but that is a future plan once completed.
