**Possible Minor Spoilers**

Welcome to the world of Hogwarts Legacy, a highly anticipated action RPG that invites players to immerse themselves in the universe of Harry Potter. Developed by [Avalanche Software](https://www.avalanchesoftware.com/), this game takes us back in time, long before the events of the Harry Potter series, offering a fresh take on the popular franchise.

## Gameplay

Gameplay has been a long standing issue in Harry Potter games and was a personal concern going into Hogwarts Legacy. The game categorises itself as an Action/Adventure RPG with a conscious connection to Harry Potter lore.

Combat is a mandatory mechanic and arguably the most important in a game of this style. Hogwarts Legacy handled this well including a hack-and-slash style combat system similar to the WB implementation for the [Batman Arkham](https://arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Arkham_Wiki) series with an emphasis on 'basic cast' and countering with 'protego and stupefy'.

Alongside the basic cast in combat there are a large array of spells at the players disposal. Each spell has a different effect on the environment or person it is cast on. In combat, these spells have a cooldown dependent on the effectiveness of the spell and amount of damaged cause which the developers definitely found the right balance for.

Spells are also imperative to how the player interacts with the environment from being undetected by enemies to solving puzzles using blocks and 'wingardium leviosa' and the wide range of spells do not convolute the puzzle solving process.

The further a player progresses through the main quests, the more mechanics are made available to them. Firstly, the room of requirement, I personally was surprised at how late on it felt to have access to the room given it was a key part of the marketing and pre-release gameplay. However, it is unlocked around 1/3 of the way through the main quests. The room of requirements allows for player creativity with a useful modification mechanic in the form of 'transfiguration' spells and a house-elf named Deke to change the ambience when you wish.

The room of requirements allows for players to begin to grow/harvest plants, brew potions and discover/upgrade new equipment all in a singular place which is very convenient and when the later beast mechanics are added, allows for near self-sufficiency and not needing to buy or source many rare ingredients at all.

Speaking of the beasts mechanics, it is what can best be described as a pokemon/tamagotchi mini game where you can collect beasts from the wild using the 'Nab-sack' and keep them within specific vivariums in the Room of Requirement where you can feed, care for and breed beasts alongside collecting their rare materials. There is very little expansion in this area other than the 'catch 'em all' gamer mentality as collecting a large array of beasts does not effect the wider world, story or provide any reasonable advantage other than rare ingredients.

Exploration plays a significant role in Hogwarts Legacy. The game encourages players to venture into various areas, uncovering hidden secrets, and collecting valuable items - too many items in my opinion, making gameplay feel laboured and uncared for.  Moreover, the inclusion of a fast travel system simplifies traversing the vast game world, but encourages a lack of exploration. I feel as if a signpost system at each of the Floo stations would have been a better implementation.

Furthermore, the game introduces a Dungeon Hunter aspect that brings an additional layer of depth and challenge to the gameplay. This feature offers exciting encounters in dungeons, providing players with satisfactory but repetitive enemy encounters.

Stealth is an element of Hogwarts Legacy that falls short, the spell Petrificus Totalis is not taught through classes or people like every other spell and therefore the player is not aware of it. I personally only knew it existed due to the pre-release gameplay and stumbled upon it during the game wondering when I would get to learn it. The invisibility potions and spell are good additions to add potential gameplay variety. However, it does feel as if the developers had a hack-and-slash style of player more in mind.

On the downside, Hogwarts Legacy falls short in some areas. Despite the engaging combat mechanics, there is a possibility that the gameplay may still feel repetitive after extended play sessions. Additionally, the late access to the Room of Requirement, considering its marketing importance, might disappoint players who were eager to utilise its features earlier in the game. Furthermore, the gameplay progression may require players to invest a significant amount of time in collecting various items, which could potentially feel like a grind for some players. Lastly, the late game economy may require balancing to avoid potential imbalance or tedious grinding.

## Graphics & Sound

Advertised as a Series X optimised game, Hogwarts Legacy definitely lives up to the modern standard of 4k gaming. There are no clear textures or jagged edges and the game runs smoothly at 60fps. The game includes two modes, fidelity and performance like many AAA games nowadays. I chose to stick with performance for the 60fps and the game still looked great.

As for sound, the soundtrack paid clear homage to the original Harry Potter films and games. The music was well composed and fit the game well. The voice acting was also well done, with each character having a unique voice and personality. However, the voice acting was not always consistent, with some characters having noticeably different voices in different scenes. This was particularly noticeable with the protagonist, whose voice changed significantly between scenes, likely due to the modularity of the voice customisation.

## Story and Replay Value

Set before the events of the Harry Potter franchise, Hogwarts Legacy does an excellent job of introducing characters with unique personalities and connections to the franchise, such as Matilda Weasley and Phineas Black.

The story consists of an overarching storyline and a series of side quests and relationship quests, each with its own timeline and events.

Overall, the main story loses its magical qualities within the first 10 hours, gradually becoming repetitive and monotonous the longer you play. However, the storytelling effectively sets the tone and concludes the story, leaving little to be desired. While a slightly longer story would have been welcome, it did not ultimately detract from the overall experience, especially considering the current trend of excessively long stories.

The relationship quests provide an opportunity to delve deeper into character development and make the overall "student" experience more immersive. The quest storylines are engaging, with each companion having distinct backgrounds and interests. However, the stark differences between the characters can feel somewhat contrived and break the immersion at times.

Sebastian's relationship quest line is particularly intriguing, focusing on his determination to cure his sister from a mysterious curse that prevents her from attending Hogwarts. This series of quests raises ethical concerns about whether the ends justify the means and tests how far you are willing to support his actions. Pragmatically, this quest line allows you to learn the three unforgivable curses at various points, with obvious dialogue choices.

Poppy's quest line revolves around protecting beasts from poachers. It provides a clear contrast to Sebastian's story, with a more straightforward moral compass. However, this quest series missed several opportunities for gameplay and narrative surrounding different beasts and could have explored the beast vivariums in the Room of Requirement in more depth. There seemed to be a disconnect between the two storylines, and it would have been logical for the protagonist to allow Poppy to see the vivariums where creatures are collected, bred, and cared for. The quest line concludes peacefully, but the gameplay leading up to it can become monotonous with few engaging events.

Natty's quest line adds much-needed context to the wizarding world. Having recently joined Hogwarts from [Uagadou](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Uagadou) and being the daughter of the divination professor, she brings a wealth of knowledge and unique experiences to the group. However, her determination often comes across as obsessive, hindering character development beyond learning about her past experiences. The revelation of Natty being an animagus and specialising in non-wand magic had more story potential than was utilised, only becoming significantly relevant toward the end of the quest line.

In addition to specific relationship quest lines, Hogwarts Legacy also offers a variety of general side quests scattered throughout the world, each with its own context and story to tell. The quality of these quests varies, but they generally follow similar structures, which can make them feel monotonous over time, reminiscent of my personal experience with Assassin's Creed: Origins.

Hogwarts Legacy intentionally avoids delving deeply into in-game morality, maintaining a neutral stance in response to pre-release inquiries. While decisions exist, they don't necessarily fall into clear-cut good or bad categories. This summary accurately captures the game's approach, as choices have minimal impact, much like in Mass Effect 3.

Replay value: After recently completing the main storyline and primary relationship quests, I don't foresee much replayability in Hogwarts Legacy. The only noticeable changes upon replaying the game would be minor story differences based on the player's house (Hufflepuff being the only house to visit Azkaban) and the potential to alter some decisions that appear to have no lasting effects.



## Technical Performance

In terms of performance of Hogwarts Legacy on the Xbox Series X, it was a smooth overall experience that you could expect from any AAA title. However, there were still issues present even months after launch.

Some issues I found during my play through the game included:

- A firework style pattern and colour effect on the edges of textures between interiors and exteriors. This was made more apparent whilst using the Disillusionment charm.
- Pausing during a battle could lead to unstoppable controller vibrations until either the game was resumed or quit.
- The RT trigger was not always detected during gameplay, increasing the difficulty of battles significantly.
- Following on from the trigger issues, at times controller inputs to dodge or use the Protego charm were not always registered leading to fights being more difficult, health being drained and potions being used at a higher rate. This was especially difficult in the final battle of the main quest where I used roughly 18 Wiggenweld potions to defeat the final boss when I could have used half if the controller input system was more polished.
