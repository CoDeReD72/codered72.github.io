    <h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>It is tradition, I would even argue religious, for the first thing you do when an application, program or website works would be to use a 'Hello World' and for many is the summation of all there efforts to get to a place where their work (however big or small) has come to fruition.</p>
<h2>How did This Get Here?</h2>
<p>Being in the final year of my degree I am at a giant crossroads of what my life could be in 6-8 months time, when the idea of the next deadline or the looming 'Final Year Project' is all a thing of the past; for better or for worse. So what seems like a better time to put myself out there than now?</p>
<p>The process of creating this blog is something I used as a project to push myself and broaden my horizons as a potential developer in the future. Programming and Web Technologies going into University were what I would have considered my strengths and I was all the more interested in immersing myself in that world, where logic and creativity combine in order to produce 'something' whether it is the next big thing or just a basic git pull script that runs on startup.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, life has a way of getting in the way. Covid and other personal factors throughout the University experience has made me put my ability to develop on the backburner often for what ever module my degree required at the time, knowing I had just enough to get through a programming module if I applied myself to pick up what I used to find natural.</p>
<p>So this is a new beginning of sorts, apt for the 'Hello World!' title. My aim is to start undertaking projects as large or as small as they may be and publish them both here and on my Github profile to give a sense of me and what I can do, specifically just to prove to myself I can. These projects will not necessarily be all technology based and some posts may not be about projects at all. But this blog is here to document my journey going forward and what cool stuff I get up to!</p>
