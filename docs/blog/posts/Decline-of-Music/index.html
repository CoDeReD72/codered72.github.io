      <h1>Under Appreciation of Music and Other Creative Arts in Modern Education</h1>

      <h2>GCSE and A-Level Results</h2>
<p>It's that time of year again! GCSE and A-Level results days are pivotal in the futures of all 16-18 year olds in this country. Whilst the majority of coverage of these results show the percentage range between 9-5 (A*-C) grades, the increase/decrease in subject popularity paints a much more interesting picture.</p>
<p>One of these trends I have followed personally over the years is the decline in music GCSE and A-Level students. In the past year, there has been a 12.5% decrease in the number of GCSE music students to 29,732 (out of a 643,095 student 2022/23 cohort). Similarly, A-Level saw a decline of 7%. Unfortunately, a decline in uptake is to be expected, as this has been the long-term trend across creative subjects since the introduction of the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) programme in 2010.</p>
<h2>The English Baccalaureate Programme</h2>
<p>The intended purpose of the EBacc programme is to set out a number of GCSE subjects in order to keep the prospects of successful students as open as possible.</p>
<p>These subjects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>English Language &amp; Literature</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>The Sciences (incl. Trilogy, Combined and Computer Science)</li>
<li>Geography/History</li>
<li>Languages (Ancient/Modern)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Government outlook on the EBacc programme is to have a student uptake of 75% by 2022, and a further 90% by 2025. This has been a successful venture where 82% of all subject choices for the 2022 cohort were EBacc subjects.</p>
<p>The adoption and promotion of the EBacc programme by default, reduces the potential and actual uptake of any creative arts at the GCSE level. Each individual school varies in their internal policy for GCSE options such as the number of subjects or the scheduling of specific subject lessons preventing some combinations. Personally, I was required to take at least one EBacc subject (Computer Science - Luckily!) of four optional subjects. However, not all schools offer four optional subjects to students in order to make the newer, more difficult, specifications more manageable for the cohort. Therefore, the viability of creative subjects is diminished within the GCSE process.</p>
<h2>Importance of Creative Arts in Soft Skill Development</h2>
<p>Many people question, how are creative subjects be important? Why would I study or let my child study creative subjects? Is it really worth it, how will it help them in 'real' life? The answer to that is, creative arts are massively underestimated and teach transferrable skills that will help every child in any walk of life. Including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Confidence</li>
<li>Professionalism</li>
<li>Teamwork and Leadership</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving</li>
<li>Time Management</li>
<li>Research</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds pretty similar to all the soft skills employers are looking for, right? That's because they are! The creative arts are a great way to develop these skills in a fun and engaging way whilst also increasing social skills and improving participants mental health in many cases.</p>
<h2>Creativity and Mental Health</h2>
<p>The creative arts are a great way to express yourself and your emotions, whether that be through music, art, dance, drama, or any other creative outlet. This level of emotional expression is a great way to improve mental health, wellbeing and emotional control/intelligence.</p>
<p>One way this has been shown in the public image would be the work of Gareth Malone, a celebrity chorister who assembles a number of choirs for different purposes/events in his documentaries. Most famously the Military Wives Choir, a choir of wives of military personnel who were deployed in Afghanistan. The choir was formed to help the wives cope with the deployment of their husbands and the emotional stress that comes with it. The choir was a massive success and even had a number one single in the UK charts.</p>
<p>## Impact on the Music Industry</p>
<p>The inspiration for this post stems from finding an archived documentary, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rhghl">A Band for Britain</a>. Sue Perkins attempts to rejuvenate a Brass Band on it's last leg after her success on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maestro_(British_TV_series)">Maestro</a>. As a musician who started in the Youth system of a Brass Band, continuing into my teenage years before branching out, it was a hard watch. Despite being filmed in 2009, the issues the band faces in regard to a lack of players, financial difficulties and a lack of youth intake were all an early sign of what many bands were going to face.</p>
<p>One statistic that stood out to me during the documentary was that 'For every £1,000 Opera receives from the Arts Council, Brass Bands receive £1.' While this may not still be entirely valid, the sentiment is definitely still prominent. Even within the Creative Arts industry there is a sense of elitism and lack of willingness to fund community groups or projects which help introduce more people to the arts.</p>
<p>Brass Bands specifically, are known for their generosity for introducing people to the world of music. It is customary for bands to provide free instruments to new members and mentoring from section colleagues in either the full band or specific Youth and Training Bands, often led by music teachers for little to no yearly cost to the musician.</p>
<p>Ultimately, without the 'grassroots' of music, there will not be any future professionals. Whether music education comes academically through course uptake or community banding, music education is both beneficial and essential for the maintenance of the music infrastructure of the UK. Let alone being the third highest grossing industry in the UK.</p>
<p>These GCSE and A-Level declines is a concerning indicator that there is no promotion for people to benefit from the arts or pursue a career (or even hobby) in them!</p>
