# Personal Blog

Initially a mini-project to cover over a weekend and maintain over time.

Creating a personal blog site utilising Eleventy, Nunjucks in conjunction with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The aim of the blog is to highlight current events in my life whether it is technology based or a more personal interest.

Learning eleventy over the course of a weekend proven to be a challenge but a rewarding one. I have learnt a lot about the static site generator and how it can be used to create a blog site. It also cemented my ability to adapt to new technologies/frameworks and learn them quickly.
