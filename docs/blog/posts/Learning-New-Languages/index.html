      <h1>Exposure to more Languages</h1>

      <p>Over the last weeks/months I have been trying to expose myself to as many different ways of thinking and problem solving as possible. Including considering memory management, thinking functionally and keeping up-to-date with Rust.</p>
<p>I have taken to learning the basics of the following languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>Haskell</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust as a language, <em>despite the steep learning curve</em>, exhibits everything I loved about Java when I was first learning it years ago. However, knowing more about programming languages and concepts as a whole, Rust definitely seems the new frontier in development if it becomes widely adopted.</p>
<p>In order to improve my problem solving and logical thinking skills I have undertaken some of the <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> tasks which are grounded in mathematical problems which requires the programmer to apply them in a language of their choice. I have chosen Javascript as an initial solution, to then convert to more advanced, strictly typed and managed languages in order to boost proficiency in all of them effectively.</p>
