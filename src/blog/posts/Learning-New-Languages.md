Over the last weeks/months I have been trying to expose myself to as many different ways of thinking and problem solving as possible. Including considering memory management, thinking functionally and keeping up-to-date with Rust.

I have taken to learning the basics of the following languages:
- C
- Rust
- Haskell


Rust as a language, *despite the steep learning curve*, exhibits everything I loved about Java when I was first learning it years ago. However, knowing more about programming languages and concepts as a whole, Rust definitely seems the new frontier in development if it becomes widely adopted.

In order to improve my problem solving and logical thinking skills I have undertaken some of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) tasks which are grounded in mathematical problems which requires the programmer to apply them in a language of their choice. I have chosen Javascript as an initial solution, to then convert to more advanced, strictly typed and managed languages in order to boost proficiency in all of them effectively.
