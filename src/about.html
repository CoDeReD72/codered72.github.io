    <h1>Hi, Welcome to my Blog</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Declan and I am an Undergraduate Student of Computer Science at
      the University of Portsmouth. I decided to make this blog a personal
      project of mine after not using any web technologies in years.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The aim of this blog is to showcase what I get up to and also my different
      projects, topics I find interesting and my non-computing related hobbies.
      I hope you like this mini insight into my life!
    </p>
